# MatrixCL
OpenCL based matrix library.

This project is the precessor of my Bachelor Thesis, consisting of writing an OpenCL BiCGStab solver in OpenCL. The aim is to provide an easy-to-use standalone matrix library for C++ with an OpenCL backend.

# Status

The project is under development. Currently no working instance exists.
